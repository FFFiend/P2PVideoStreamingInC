How to Approach Writing the Protocol in C

Here’s a high-level guide to how you could write the various components of a P2P video streaming system in C:
1. Networking Layer

    Use Berkeley Sockets API for low-level networking. You'll need to implement both TCP and UDP socket handling.
    For P2P connections, you could use UDP for low-latency streaming but fall back to TCP for reliability in certain cases (e.g., signaling).
    Implement NAT traversal using the STUN or TURN protocols. These are complex to write from scratch in C, but you can find C libraries like libnice for NAT traversal.

2. Video Chunking and Encoding

    Use FFmpeg (a C library) for video encoding, decoding, and chunking. You can transcode video into different bitrates and split it into smaller chunks for streaming.
    Video chunking could follow a format like HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or MPEG-DASH, which creates segmented video files that peers download and reassemble.
    You can leverage libavcodec (from FFmpeg) to handle encoding and decoding, which is highly performant and widely used.

3. Peer Discovery

    Implement a tracker or a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for peers to find each other.
    You can implement a DHT using Kademlia (used by BitTorrent). This would allow you to have a decentralized peer-discovery system.
    If you prefer a simpler, centralized approach, create a tracker server that peers query to find other peers.

4. Chunk Distribution and Data Transfer

    After discovering peers, you’ll need to send and receive video chunks. Use UDP for video transfer (for low-latency) but handle packet loss and reordering (UDP does not guarantee delivery).
    For reliable data transfer, you can implement forward error correction (FEC) or retransmission mechanisms to deal with packet loss.
    Alternatively, use TCP if reliability is more important than latency (e.g., for signaling or small control packets).

5. Concurrency and Buffering

    Use pthreads for multi-threading. Each peer connection could run on a separate thread to download/upload video chunks.
    Use a ring buffer to implement buffering on the client side. This will store chunks temporarily and handle playback to avoid stuttering during the stream.

6. Playback

    For video playback on the client side, you can either:
        Use a media player like VLC that supports streaming or custom protocols.
        Use the FFmpeg API to decode video streams directly and display them using a simple graphical toolkit like SDL.

7. Security and Encryption

    Encrypt video chunks using TLS/SSL or any encryption library like OpenSSL to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
    You might also want to sign and verify chunks to prevent tampering by malicious peers.

Libraries to Use in C

    FFmpeg/Libav: For video encoding/decoding and chunking.
    libnice: For NAT traversal.
    libevent or libuv: For event-driven, asynchronous IO. Useful for handling multiple connections without manually writing thread management code.
    OpenSSL: For encryption and securing communication between peers.
    SQLite: Optionally, you can use an embedded database like SQLite for peer tracking or caching video chunks.

Workflow and Key Implementation Steps

    Set Up a Basic P2P Network:
        Start by writing the networking layer, using either TCP or UDP for connections.
        Implement basic peer discovery, either using a centralized tracker or a DHT for distributed discovery.

    Implement Video Chunking:
        Use FFmpeg to split video into small chunks.
        Implement logic for requesting and sending these chunks between peers.

    Handle Video Playback:
        Use FFmpeg or SDL to handle playback.
        Implement buffering and a mechanism to assemble video chunks for smooth playback.

    Optimize for Real-Time Streaming:
        Tweak the chunk size and buffer length to balance latency and playback smoothness.
        Implement algorithms for selecting optimal peers based on network performance.
